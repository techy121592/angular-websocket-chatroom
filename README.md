# Angular WebSocket Chatroom

**This was quickly programmed for a coding challenge.**

This is a simple chatroom application that I wrote using Angular2 and NodeJS which uses WebSockets to communicate in real-time.

In order the run this you will need to execute `npm start` in this directory and `ng serve` inside of the `client` directory.
